# Password-Generator

As a developer I want to understand how JavaScript can work alongside HTML and CSS so that I can further build my skillset and knowledge.

# Lessons Learned

The original password generator didn't have any stored data to generate. Initially, I thought to try the prompt method as was learned in previous game activity.

However, the more I worked with the promt the more I felt how impractical the perameters. I have never personally had to use an alert box so I thought I would go with something more intuitive, like check boxes. So with a lot of help and research, I established the checkbox input type in the html.

With the variables I wanted to establish, through trial and error (mostley error) I was able to work out the makeAPassword function. I left in sections of starter code as well as some of my faiures that I commented out for later personal reference.
